    "- `print`\n",
    "- `input`\n",
    "- `len`\n",
    "- `sum`\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to run one of these functions (also \"call\" or \"execute\" a function), then we put parentheses after its name. That tells Python that we want to run the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do we need the ability to write new functions? No... we could absolutely program a computer without them. But it would be very hard to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we define a new function, we define a new verb. \n",
    "\n",
    "The big idea here is *abstraction* -- the idea that we can ignore the lower levels, with greater detail, so that we can think at a higher level and do bigger things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions let us package up lower-level functionality under a single name. Then, after that function is defined and known to work, we can use it as a lower-level brick to build our higher-level functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason we want functions is purely practical: It fulfills the \"DRY\" rule (don't repeat yourself). If we have the same code in multiple places in a program, it's going to be easier to write and maintain the software if those duplicated sections are packaged up into functions, and then we invoke the function every time we want to do that thing."

There should be whitespace between the first set of digits and the operator, and between the operator and the last set of digits.  \n",

    "5. If the operator isn't known, you can just print an error message. Or if you prefer, you can print the equation with `?` as the result, rather than the answer.\n",
