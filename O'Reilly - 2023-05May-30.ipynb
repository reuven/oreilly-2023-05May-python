    "Remember that outside of a function definition, all variables are *global*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inside of a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we *set* a variable, then that variable is considered *local*.\n",
    "- If we ask for a variable value, then Python:\n",
    "    - First looks inside of the function for a local variable of that name\n",
    "    - If it doesn't find a local variable of that name, then it looks for a global of that name\n",
    "    \n",
    "LEGB -- local, enclosing, global, and builtin -- is the way that Python searches for variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I'm inside of a function, we might very well encounter a situation where there is a local variable with the same name as a global variable. However, based on what we've seen so far, there is no way for us to assign to the global variable of that same name. Once there's a local variable \"shadowing\" the global, we're out of luck.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to get around this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the `global` declaration in the function. This gets rid of the local variable; all references to that name are now global.\n",
    "2. Import the `__main__` module from the Python standard library. That gives you access to all of the global variables via that namespace/module."

    "It cleans up our code, making it easier to (a) write, (b) maintain, and (c) think about.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you have the same code several lines in a row, then you should replace that code with a loop.\n",
    "2. If you have the same code in several different parts of your program, you should write a function and then invoke the function in all of those places.\n",
    "3. If you have the same code in several different programs, I can write the functionality once, and refer to it whenever I need it. This is known in the programming world as a \"library,\" and in Python, libraries are implemented using \"modules.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "But modules do more than that in Python: They also provide us with *namespaces*, ensuring that we don't have \"namespace collisions\" -- when two or more parts of a program use the same variable name, and then end up assigning their own values to the other part's variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way that modules handle this is by treating their variables as \"attributes,\" names that come after `.`. If I collaborate with someone else on a Python program, then if I write my things in a module, and they write their things in a module, we cannot have a namespace collision, because the names will be in separate modules!"
